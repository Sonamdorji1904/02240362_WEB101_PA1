# Practical Assignment 1 - React Web Page Recreation

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will apply fundamental web development concepts by recreating a web page using React's component-based architecture. By selecting and implementing a page from an existing web application, you'll demonstrate your understanding of modern front-end development techniques and React principles while building a functional, responsive interface.

## Project Overview
In this assignment, you will build a React-based web application that recreates a single webpage from an existing web application of your choice. This involves the following steps:

1. **Break down the page into multiple React components**, identifying reusable elements and component hierarchies.
2. **Create a new React application** using either Next.js or Vite to serve as your development environment.
    - Create React App has been deprecated and should not be used ([Link to blog](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app)).
3. **Identify & develop individual shared and reusable components** that follow the single responsibility principle, implementing both the visual design and interactive elements.
    - Example: The Facebook Post Card is a reusable component. ![Facebook Mobile Post Mockup](https://unblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Facebook-Mobile-Post-Mockup.jpg)
4. **Implement responsive design** to ensure proper display across different device sizes.
5. **Document your component structure, implementation decisions, and any third-party dependencies used in the README.md.**
6. **Test your implementation across different browsers and screen sizes** to ensure consistency before your submission for mobile phones, tablet, and desktop screens.
7. **Create a comprehensive README.md file** explaining your approach, and component architecture diagrams are encouraged to be used.
